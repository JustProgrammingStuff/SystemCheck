# SystemCheck
This program is for 2 core cpus(i use it on my server pc), 
to customize your core values add more text files and change the math, 
it also measures available RAM and tells you available Storage.

It measures the percentage of your cores and saves each one to a text file, then it divides it by 2
(instead of 2 you would put your amount of cores)
